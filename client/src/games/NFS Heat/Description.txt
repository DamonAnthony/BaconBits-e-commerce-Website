In Need for Speed Heat, the lines of the law fade when the sun starts to set. By daylight, compete in the Speedhunter Showdown, a series of sanctioned events where you can earn Bank to customize your personal fleet of cars. When your ride’s styled just right, ramp up the intensity at night. Enter illicit street races with your die-hard crew but stay ready – rogue cops are waiting. Take chances, burn competitors to increase your Rep, and risk it all for underground glory.
